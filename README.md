I worked on the problem statement of "AI-powered Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with Monitor Data Integration." I developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline to analyze retinal images. In order to do so, I incorporated vital sign data from the ICU using the YOLOv8 model, achieving high accuracy (mAP50 greater than 0.98) for vital detection.
